PROBLEM
-------------------
For the ERD in Figure 1, you should indicate applications of the identifying relationship rule. For each identifying relationship rule application, you should indicate the changes to the tables you listed in problem 2.
-----------------------------------------

Student(StdNo,StdName,StdCity,StdState,StdZip,StdEmail)
PK :- StdNo

Institution(InstID,InstName,InstMascot)
PK :- InstID

Lender(LenderNo,LendName)
PK :- LenderNo

Loan(LoanNo,StdNo,InstID,LenderNo,ProcDate,DisbMethod,DisbBank,DateAuth,NoteValue,Subsidized,Rate)
PK :- LoanNo
---->
foreign key(StdNo) references Student
foreign key(InstID) references Institution
foreign key(LenderNo) references Lender
StdNo NOT NULL
InstID NOT NULL
LenderNo NOT NULL

DisbuseLine(LoanNo,DateSent,Amount,OrigFee,GuarFee)
PK :- DateSent
foreign key(LoanNo) references Loan

Conversion rules..
-------------------------
Use the entity type rule to convert each entity type.
Use the 1-M relationship rule for all relationships.
Use M-M relationship rule[not needed].
use the identification dependency rule to make LoanNo a component of the Primary Key of DisburseLine.The Primary Key of the DisburseLine table is a Combination of LoanNo and DateSent. a not null constraint is not needed for DisburseLine. LoanNo because this column is part of the primary key of DisburseLine.
